            <div class="post-content">
                <h2 id="the-why">The Why?</h2>
<p>The more I work on massive software projects with no end in sight,<del>the less I want to work on projects with no end in sight</del> the more I want to work on smaller projects with a specialized purpose.</p>
<p>You see, there are these thoughts that keep bothering me from time to time. Sofware&rsquo;s lack of physical quality and tangibility, and the general uselessness of most software beyond maximizing shareholder value.
90% of software engineers have the same frustrations, I based that claim on no data at all.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, back to the project, the actual thing that got it rolling was the wild summer weather, no forecast would provide accurate data for the whole day, micro storms would come out of nowhere.
That&rsquo;s how &lsquo;Weather!&rsquo; was born, out of my frustrations with software engineering and strange weather patterns.
It&rsquo;s my little escapade toy project that also happens to predict the future!</p>
<p>Is this the remedy? Periodically build these small self-contained, very specialized projects to chase away the tedium? maybe!</p>
<h2 id="the-build">The build</h2>
<p>Plenty of articles cover how to drive a Neopixel LED strip using a Raspberry Pi, where and how to fetch your local weather so I&rsquo;m not getting into that.
The animations are also nothing spectacular, you know the drill, compute the pixel value based on the current step in the animation loop and write the updates to the display 60 times a second. Going for a cinematic look? just update the screen at 12 FPS, might also save some CPU cycles.</p>

<p>The first 48 cells represent the mapped hourly temperatures, and the last 8 cells just show the max daily temperatures for today and the next 7 days, respectively, 8 cells in total. The cell also can flash with different shades of blue to indicate the severity of precipitations.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="bonus-feature">Bonus feature</h2>
<p>A clock! 64 cells per day or 1.35 kiloseconds per cell! enough to neatly map the sunrise and sunset, you can never have too many ways to show the current time.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/clock_face.gif"/>
</figure>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would call a needed distraction from the repetition of daily work.
It&rsquo;s easy initially to dismiss its usefulness but I&rsquo;ve been using it every day to decide when to go out for a run or cycling.
My two cents, build small projects for yourself, finish them, feel better, repeat.</p>
