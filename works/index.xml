      <description>Mount St. Helens hillshade
This article might get too technical in places with all the CNC, CAM, CAD, GIS terminology. To spare your time here&amp;rsquo;s the TLDR:
TLDR More than 6 month ago something clicked and I got all enthusiastic about maps and topography. 2D renders were all nice and cool but real 3D topographic sculpts would really elevate the data to a higher level.
Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make detailed models and there are quite a few reasons why nobody (at least documented online) seems to have a solid working process or a comercial product that isn&amp;rsquo;t just a 2D print.</description>

      <title>Custom force-feedback controller and next gen predictions</title>

      <description>TL;DR I wanted a controller specifically made for racing sim games, with force feedback like on the big expensive sim racing wheels, so I made one.
One is a bit different than the others
The Inspiration The new PS5 controller with its haptics and adaptive triggers marks the dawn of a new era.
Adaptive triggers internals, isn&amp;rsquo;t that cool?
What even is FFB? and why it makes things better? Maybe the industry will move towards an &amp;ldquo;FFB all the things&amp;rdquo; approach, maybe not, let&amp;rsquo;s test it out and see its pros and cons.</description>

      <title>Metalens for Hacker News</title>

      <description>Update: The app is now open source The app is no longer on AppStore, a cleaned-up and rewritten version is now available on GitHub
Download it on the app store TL;DR: If you downloaded the app don&amp;rsquo;t forget to toggle the Safari switch in Settings
The &amp;ldquo;Do something with Hacker News&amp;rdquo; idea Searching for HN clients on the app store results in many reasonable looking apps. Some of them abandoned a few years back, others look like a developer needed at least one random published app to apply for the job.</description>

      <title>A proper hardware plugin for the OP-Z synth</title>
      <link>https://3am.engineering/works/opz-modular-synth-plugin/</link>

      <description>The, previous attempt at an OP-Z plugin thingy was a failure.
The boot time, the bugs, and overhead that come with running Linux + jack + supercollider stack on such a Raspberry Pi Zero is too much. You don&amp;rsquo;t need Linux if you want to run a medium complexity synth. But it also failed at being fun and easy to use.
Teesny 3.6 and teensy audio board
With teensy 3.6 &amp;amp; teensy audio board, the boot times are around a second or less, it&amp;rsquo;s faster than the OP-Z!</description>

      <title>Skip that intro! - Matching audio segments in multiple files</title>

      <description>If you ever binge-watched a series you should already be familiar with the urge to skip ASAP that intro/outro song.
Many streaming services already have a skip intro button, but how does it work? Did you think that the content partners need to specify timestamps for intro/outros at the content ingest stage? That would be too easy.
I attempted to automate the intro detection with chromaprint mostly for fun because it seems that was my definition of fun at the time.</description>

      <title>A hardware plugin for the OP-Z synth</title>

      <description>2019 Update Half of this article is irrelevant now, OP-Z can sample from USB or the mic and supports custom synth engines (kinda) after some updates.
Background Since I got my hands on the PO-20 “Arcade” I wanted to write custom firmware for it. Of course that wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.
The next best thing was the OTTO inspired by OP-1. I considered joining the project for a moment but writing most of the components from scratch would take years to reach a v.</description>
