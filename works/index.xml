      <title>Is this thing a next-next-gen controller?</title>

      <description>TL;DR I wanted a controller specifically made for racing sim games, with force feedback like on the big expensive sim racing wheels, so I made one.
  The Inspiration The new PS5 controller with its haptics and adaptive triggers marks the dawn of a new era [citation needed]. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what the reviewers say, I&amp;rsquo;ll give them the benefit of the doubt since I can&amp;rsquo;t get my hands on one.</description>

      <description>Download it on the app store TL;DR: If you downloaded the app don&amp;rsquo;t forget to toggle the Safari switch in Settings
  The &amp;ldquo;Do something with Hacker News&amp;rdquo; idea Searching for HN clients on the app store results in many reasonable looking apps. Some of them abandoned a few years back, others look like a developer needed at least one random published app to apply for the job.</description>

      <title>A proper hardware plugin for the OP-Z synth</title>

      <description>The, previous attempt at an OP-Z plugin thingy was a failure.
The boot time, the bugs, and overhead that come with running Linux + jack + supercollider stack on such a Raspberry Pi Zero is too much. You don&amp;rsquo;t need Linux if you want to run a medium complexity synth. But it also failed at being fun and easy to use.

      <title>Skip that intro!</title>

      <description>If you ever binge-watched a series you should already be familiar with the urge to skip ASAP that intro/outro song.
Many streaming services already have a skip intro button, but how does it work? Did you think that the content partners need to specify timestamps for intro/outros at the content ingest stage? That would be too easy.
I attempted to automate the intro detection with chromaprint mostly for fun because it seems that was my definition of fun at the time.</description>

      <description>Update 19.07.01 Update, half of this article is irrelevant now, OP-Z can sample from USB or the mic and support custom synth engines (kinda) after some updates.
Background Since I got my hands on the PO-20 “Arcade” I wanted to write custom firmware for it. Of course that wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.
The next best thing was the OTTO inspired by OP-1. I considered joining the project for a moment but writing most of the components from scratch would take years to reach a v.</description>
