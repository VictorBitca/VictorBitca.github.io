      <description>Download it on the app store TL;DR: If you downloaded the app don&amp;rsquo;t forget to toggle the Safari switch in Settings
  The &amp;ldquo;Do something with Hacker News&amp;rdquo; idea Searching for HN clients on the app store results in many reasonable looking apps, some of them clearly abandoned, some look like a developer needed at least one random published app to apply for the job.
If another HN client is to be built, it needs to stand out with its gimmicks and questionable features.</description>

      <title>A proper OP-Z plugin</title>

      <description>The, previous attempt at an OP-Z plugin thingy was a failure.
The boot time, the bugs, and overhead that come with running Linux + jack + supercollider stack on such a Raspberry Pi Zero is too much. You don&amp;rsquo;t need Linux if you want to run a medium complexity synth. But it also failed at being fun and easy to use.

      <title>Skip that intro</title>

      <description>If you ever binge-watched a series you should already be familiar with the urge to skip ASAP that intro/outro song.
Many streaming services already have a skip intro button, but how does it work? Did you think that the content partners need to specify timestamps for intro/outros at the content ingest stage? That would be too easy.
I attempted to automate the intro detection with chromaprint mostly for fun because it seems that was my definition of fun at the time.</description>

      <title>An OP-Z plugin</title>

      <description>Update On 19.07.01 there was a firmware update, now OP-Z can sample from usb or the mic making half of this article deprecated.
Intro It began in the summer of 2018, when I’ve been playing with my PO-20 “Arcade” wondering if it&amp;rsquo;s hackable, maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a community around hacking pocket operators like there is one for Canon “Magic Lantern” firmware.
There is no such thing. But there is OTTO, an open source project initially inspired by OP-1 but clearly going in their own direction at the moment, consider contributing if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.</description>
