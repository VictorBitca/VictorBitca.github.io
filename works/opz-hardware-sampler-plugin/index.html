            <div class="post-content">
                <h2 id="2019-update">2019 Update</h2>
<p>Half of this article is irrelevant now, OP-Z can sample from USB or the mic and supports custom synth engines (kinda) after some updates.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Since I got my hands on the <a href="https://www.teenageengineering.com/store#po-20">PO-20 “Arcade”</a> I wanted to write custom firmware for it. Of course that wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<p>The next best thing was the <a href="https://github.com/topisani/OTTO"><code>OTTO</code></a> inspired by <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1">OP-1</a>. I considered joining the project for a moment but writing most of the components from scratch would take years to reach a v.1.0 prototype.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools-for-the-job">The tools for the job</h2>
<p>I considered using  <a href="https://puredata.info/">Pure Data</a> in a similar way the  <a href="https://www.critterandguitari.com/organelle">Critter and Guitari Organelle</a> is using it.
But after a few frustrating days it was clear that visual programming will not cut it.</p>
<p>Comparing communities, language features and GitHub stars of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_audio_synthesis_environments">audio synthesis environments&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a> was looking like a winner.
With an active open source community, it was like a silver bullet for all my problems,
SuperCollider can easily be set up to run on a <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/README_RASPBERRY_PI.md">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<h2 id="first-prototypes">First prototypes</h2>
<p>The choice of hardware at that moment was clear, a Raspberry Pi Zero and a dedicated audio board (<a href="https://fe-pi.com/">Fe-Pi</a> or <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html">Teensy audio adaptor</a> both based on the same chip) would do the trick.
Combined with a ~2000 mAh battery it should run for ~4 hours, still not as much as I would like but it will do for the moment.</p>

<p>The first prototype made with Fusion 360 and the plastic parts printed, It, of course, had a few drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The buttons, I did not like the feel of the tall silicone buttons.</li>
<li>Not enough buttons.</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="/images/sequencer_render.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>The second prototype used mechanical keyboard buttons and a lot more of them.
Initially, I cloned Volca Sample functional plus some extra stuff.</p>

         alt="OP-1 anyone?"/><figcaption>
            <p>OP-1 anyone?</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then I looked into how OP-Z handles the sequencing and started to recreate it in SuperCollider. The timing didn&rsquo;t feel that good, it could be the underpowered hardware plus that SuperCollider is actually two components: scsynth + sclang communicating through the network stack.
Sooner rather than later I took the plunge and got an OP-Z.</p>
<h2 id="op-z-era">OP-Z Era</h2>

</figure>

<p>After spending some time with OP-Z I thought there is no point to try to recreate the sequencer, it would take too much time. I decided to reuse the Raspberry Pi and audio IO board and slapped them on the back of my OP-Z, it seemed the most reasonable way to get the most out of it in the shortest time possible, OP-Z already had the sequencer that I wanted but it didn&rsquo;t have any sampling capabilities(at the time of writing) so it should be a beautiful fusion.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-build-something-similar-please-dontt">How to build something similar (please dont&rsquo;t)</h4>
<p>Part list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dedicated <a href="https://fe-pi.com/">audio board</a> with Line-In and Line-Out, Raspbian <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/pull/1867">suports</a> it out of the box.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi of your choice.</li>
<li>A 5V power supply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build SuperCollider from source on <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/development/building-raspberrypi">Raspberry Pi</a></li>
<li>Go to sleep, compilation is an overnight process on R-Pi Zero.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/VictorBitca/opz-sc-extensions">Clone/download</a> my repo.</li>
</ol>
<p>It has two folders, <code>opz-sc-extensions</code> contains SuperCollider extension, for more details on how to use <a href="http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/UsingExtensions.html">extensions</a> with SuperCollider, the <code>opz-plugin</code> folder contains some files that launches the extensions and a <code>golang-opz</code> folder.
Next you could open <code>opz-sampler.scd</code> either <code>opz-synth.scd</code> in SuperCollider or run headless:</p>
<p><code>export DISPLAY=:0.0 &amp;&amp; sclang opz-synth.scd</code></p>
<p>There are quite a few pros and cons to this approach to an op-z plugin.</p>
<h4 id="the-pros">The pros:</h4>
<ol>
<li>SuperCollider.</li>
<li>An enormous library of UGens (units that process or generate sound) for SuperCollider.</li>
<li>A community behind SuperCollider, usually you can find the answer to common questions but still, documentation is king.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-cons">The cons:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Long boot times, around 1 min caused by a massive software stack.</li>
<li>Latency, around 10 ms with just <a href="http://jackaudio.org/">jackd process</a> using 20% of the CPU.</li>
<li>Additional latency because of SuperCollder&rsquo;s <a href="http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/ClientVsServer.html">client-server architecture</a>.</li>
<li>Unstable on Raspberry Pi, more software more bugs.</li>
<li><a href="http://jackaudio.org/">jackd process</a> would crash after one minute of inactivity if using a reverb effect for some reason.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the end product is not as practical as I wished it was, it boots slowly, massive software overhead, buggy and still power-hungry device, SuperCollider on Raspberry Pi Zero isn&rsquo;t a good enough for this task.</p>
<h3 id="the-shape-of-things-to-come">The shape of things to come</h3>
<p>I need a device with no boot time and almost real-time performance so I&rsquo;ll go with a microcontroller, the Zero board is replaced with a
<a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html">Teensy 3.6</a>, a small beast of a microcontroller with an additional chip of <a href="https://www.electrodragon.com/product/2pcs-ipus-ips6404-iot-ram/">8MB of RAM</a>, and 32 GB of flash storage.</p>
