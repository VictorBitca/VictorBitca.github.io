      <description>Mount St. Helens hillshade
  This article might get too technical in places with all the CNC, CAM, CAD, GIS terminology. To spare your time here&amp;rsquo;s the TLDR:
TLDR  More than 6 month ago something clicked and I got all enthusiastic about maps and topography. 2D renders were all nice and cool but real 3D topographic sculpts would really elevate the data to a higher level.
Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make detailed models and there are quite a few reasons why nobody (at least documented online) seems to have a solid working process.</description>

      <title>Custom force-feedback controller and speculations on next-gen</title>

      <description>TL;DR I wanted a controller specifically made for racing sim games, with force feedback like on the big expensive sim racing wheels, so I made one.
 One is a bit different than the others
  The Inspiration The new PS5 controller with its haptics and adaptive triggers marks the dawn of a new era.
 Adaptive triggers internals, isn&amp;rsquo;t that cool?
  What even is FFB? and why it makes things better?</description>

      <title>Metalens for Hacker News</title>

      <description>Download it on the app store TL;DR: If you downloaded the app don&amp;rsquo;t forget to toggle the Safari switch in Settings
 The &amp;ldquo;Do something with Hacker News&amp;rdquo; idea Searching for HN clients on the app store results in many reasonable looking apps. Some of them abandoned a few years back, others look like a developer needed at least one random published app to apply for the job.
If another HN client is to be built, it needs some outstanding features, not necessarily useful, just something to separate it from the crowd.</description>

      <title>A proper hardware plugin for the OP-Z synth</title>
      <link>https://3am.engineering/works/second-opz-plugin/</link>

      <description>The, previous attempt at an OP-Z plugin thingy was a failure.
The boot time, the bugs, and overhead that come with running Linux + jack + supercollider stack on such a Raspberry Pi Zero is too much. You don&amp;rsquo;t need Linux if you want to run a medium complexity synth. But it also failed at being fun and easy to use.
 Teesny 3.6 and teensy audio board
  With teensy 3.</description>

      <title>Skip that intro!</title>

      <description>If you ever binge-watched a series you should already be familiar with the urge to skip ASAP that intro/outro song.
Many streaming services already have a skip intro button, but how does it work? Did you think that the content partners need to specify timestamps for intro/outros at the content ingest stage? That would be too easy.
I attempted to automate the intro detection with chromaprint mostly for fun because it seems that was my definition of fun at the time.</description>

      <title>A hardware plugin for the OP-Z synth</title>

      <description>Update 19.07.01 Update, half of this article is irrelevant now, OP-Z can sample from USB or the mic and support custom synth engines (kinda) after some updates.
Background Since I got my hands on the PO-20 “Arcade” I wanted to write custom firmware for it. Of course that wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.
The next best thing was the OTTO inspired by OP-1. I considered joining the project for a moment but writing most of the components from scratch would take years to reach a v.</description>
