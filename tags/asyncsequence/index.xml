      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on Combine and Swift concurrency for one specific use case: a potentially infinite sequence of events that could overwhelm the consumer, or at best, merely waste resources by generating excessive values that the consumer might not even require.
The values from these sequences cannot be dropped using debounce or throttle operators, as is typically done with certain UI events, thus, the need for proper backpressure support.
Subscription and Task cancellation An important aspect from an ergonomic standpoint is the lifecycle management of an entity that could potentially emit an infinite number of values.</description>
