      <description>Mount St. Helens hillshade
This article might get too technical in places with all the CNC, CAM, CAD, GIS terminology. To spare your time here&amp;rsquo;s the TLDR:
TLDR More than 6 month ago something clicked and I got all enthusiastic about maps and topography. 2D renders were all nice and cool but real 3D topographic sculpts would really elevate the data to a higher level.
Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make detailed models and there are quite a few reasons why nobody (at least documented online) seems to have a solid working process or a comercial product that isn&amp;rsquo;t just a 2D print.</description>
