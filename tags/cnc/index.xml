      <description>This article gets too technical in places, it contains CNC, CAM, CAD, GIS terminology. To spare your time here&amp;rsquo;s the TLDR:
TLDR  Got really into maps and topography, wanted to make highly detailed topographic sculpts. Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s really hard and there are quite a few reasons why nobody(at least documented online) seems to have a solid working process.
6 months of trial and error, custom hardware and software, dozens of iterations, results in detailed sculps that can surpass comercial resin 3D printers.</description>
