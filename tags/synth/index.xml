      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, previous attempt at an OP-Z plugin thingy was a failure, Main drawbacks being the boot times, all the bugs and overhead that come with running Linux &amp;amp; jack &amp;amp; supercollider on such a small machine. You just don&amp;rsquo;t need Linux if you want to run a medium complexity synth. But most importantly it kinda failed at being fun.
With teensy 3.6, the boot times are around a second or less, it&amp;rsquo;s faster than the OP-Z!</description>

      <description>Where it actually started It all began almost a year ago, when I’ve been playing with my PO-20 “Arcade” and wondered what if it was hackable, maybe if it was there would also be a community around pocket operators like there is one for Canon “Magic Lantern” firmware. Well, there was no such thing. But there is OTTO, an open source project initially inspired by OP-1 but clearly going in their own direction at the moment, consider contributing if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.</description>
